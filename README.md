This project harnesses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tailor upskilling plans for employees, leveraging their performance and existing skill sets. By analyzing data, it identifies strengths and areas for improvement, forming a strong foundation for a comprehensive employee development program in today's dynamic business environment.

Experienced employees often face the challenge of acquiring specialized skills for project assignments, hindered by limited time and resources. Manual course assignments and progress tracking for managers become resource-intensive.

To tackle this issue, we envisioned an AI-powered personalized learning app. This innovative tool tailors recommendations and guidance for employees, enabling skill enhancement and career advancement.

Project Features:

Scalable Solution: Our AI-driven app accommodates diverse job roles and experience levels, making it adaptable for organizations of any size. Customized Recommendations: The app generates individualized learning paths, suggesting courses and training programs aligned with an employee's experience. Time and Cost Efficiency: Streamlining the learning process enhances productivity and cost-effective skill development. Continuous Improvement: The app's recommendations adapt to industry trends, ensuring employees access the most relevant learning resources.

In the future, our program aims to:

Create individualized learning paths based on the analyzed data of the registered employees in Saudi Arabia.

Provide real-time feedback and support by tracking their progress, and helping them to stay on track in career growth aspect.

Support businesses with insights that empower them to develop a training program for the workforce to meet their business needs. And be a part of the contribution to the economic growth of Saudi Arabia

We are excited to continue developing our program and to work with the Hadaf Human Resources Development Fund to make it a reality for all employees in Saudi Arabia.
